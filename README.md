# monSense

monSense is an application that visualize data using chart that can be accessed via your browser.

In this early development, the visualized data is only a random number generated by javascript code and will be sent to web server. After the server receive it, the server will send it back to the browser and then will be visualized in the chart.

In the future, the random number will be replaced with a sensor like temperature sensor which can turn this appication into real-time monitoring application.
